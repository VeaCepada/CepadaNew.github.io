                <p>Being a CAI is not a volunteer teacher to ALS Learners but a responsibility and passion to provide a quality education to all 
                    learners. One of the Learning Strand in ALS is Digital Citizenship refers to the responsible use of technology by anyone 
                     uses computers, the internet, and digital devices to engage with society on any level. It encompasses the skills, knowledge,
                      and attitudes needed to participate effectively and safely in the digital world. In order for ALS Learners to do so, we CAI’s
                       needed help from professionals and skilled personnel to improve our knowledge about technology and provide better and quality
                        lectures.</p>
                <p>“Empowering Community ALS Implementers Through Digital Citizenship” is a program conducted by Information Technology (IT) Department 
                    in Northern Bukidnon State College. Wherein we were taught about the hardware it’s important features and parts of a 
                     especially inside the case in order to function. In software like the Excel/spreadsheets I learned that if you know what are
                     the correct formula for the functions you need the spreadsheets will do the calculations and counting for your data. In PowerPoint 
                     presentation which I use very often I thought that I knew well enough, but then I figured out that it was just basic features I’m 
                     using. I really like the Master Slide topic wherein I can edit and make a layout slide, that topic makes me realized that I need 
                     to maximize the features and functions in order have a great and less hassle presentation. The last topic is very new to me the 
                     creating a web page, I struggled a lot because this is very new to me but I overcome all due to how calm the lecturer and because
                      there are people around that helps me. This topic got my interest but also test my patience because one mistake can make the web 
                      page error even a period. </p>
                <p> This training helps me to improve my knowledge and skills about the technology that I can relay to ALS Learners very well. Digital 
                    Citizenship is very important to each and every one to engage with society on any level and to be safe in the digital world. 
                     am very grateful that I’m part of this training that I gain new knowledge and skills. THANK YOU</p>
